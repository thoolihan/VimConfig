#My Vim Config
I use several didn't editors, and vim isn't usually my primary editor, so you'll notice it's a pretty barebone config. 

##Install
1. cd ~/temp
2. git clone https://github.com/thoolihan/VimConfig.git
3. cp VimConfig/.{g,}vimrc ~/

##Suggestions
Feel free to end a push request if you think there are other options that make sense in a minimal vim config.
